      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        In the Castle Builders universe, every holder plays a role in expanding the realm. Starting from **80 holders**, for every **10% increase in holders**, a new castle will be added to the kingdom. These castles are generated through the **CastleBuilders AI** powered by the **MidJourney API**, bringing a magical touch to each creation. Click the button above to explore the castles of this ever-growing empire!

      <h2>The Lore of Castle Builders</h2>
      <p>
        The Castle Builders project was born from the ashes of a forgotten kingdom. The magic of the realm is tied to its people; with every milestone reached, the kingdom expands and new fortresses arise, crafted by the CastleBuilders AI. Each castle represents the collective strength of the community and the artistry of ancient craftsmanship, making $CASTLE not just a token, but a gateway to rebuilding a legendary empire.
